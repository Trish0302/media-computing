# MEDIA COMPUTING PROJECT BASED ON DIP 

Here is some guidelines for your convenience: 
1. Uploaded images are processed at function *services* in file *app/views*. Those are also stored at *media* folder at root directory. 
2. Please create *media* folder when you would like to use this application because Github doesn't store empty folder.
